This is a small game I developed in Java as a lecture for the highschool I'm teaching in.
It's an implementation of the Blackjack game with an ascii interface.
Allows multiplayer. Does not allow split rule (is a TODO).

The lecture is about subroutines and algorithms design.
The aim is to 
  • understand the power of representations. 
  • understand how much important is to design an high level algorithm decomposing the problem into subroutines.
  • deeply understand to exploit the pass by reference of parameters to methods.
  • evaluate when and why to use global or local variables.
